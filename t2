The output of the code will be as follows:

```
1
4
2
3
```

Explanation:

1. `console.log(1);`: This is a synchronous operation, so "1" will be logged to the console first.

2. `setTimeout(printNumber, 0, 2);`: This schedules the `printNumber` function to be executed asynchronously with a delay of 0 milliseconds. Even though the delay is set to 0, JavaScript will not immediately execute it. It will add the function to the event queue after all the synchronous code has finished executing.

3. `setTimeout(printNumber, 100, 3);`: This schedules another execution of the `printNumber` function asynchronously but with a delay of 100 milliseconds. As before, this will also be added to the event queue after the previous function call.

4. `console.log(4);`: This is another synchronous operation, so "4" will be logged to the console after "1".

Now, let's discuss the order of execution:

After the synchronous code execution (logging "1" and "4"), the event loop will start processing the tasks in the event queue.

1. The first task in the event queue is the `printNumber(2)` scheduled with a delay of 0 milliseconds. The function `printNumber(2)` will then log "2" to the console.

2. The second task in the event queue is the `printNumber(3)` scheduled with a delay of 100 milliseconds. The function `printNumber(3)` will then log "3" to the console.

So, after processing the event queue, the final output is "1", "4", "2", and "3" in that sequence.
