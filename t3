The code will output the following to the console:

```
array 1: length=5 last=j,o,n,e,s
array 2: length=5 last=j,o,n,e,s
```

Here's the explanation:

1. `var arr1 = "john".split('');`: The variable `arr1` is assigned an array created by splitting the string `"john"` into individual characters, resulting in `['j', 'o', 'h', 'n']`.

2. `var arr2 = arr1.reverse();`: The variable `arr2` is assigned a reference to the same array as `arr1`. The `reverse()` method is applied directly to `arr1`, reversing its elements in place. Both `arr1` and `arr2` now point to the same reversed array: `['n', 'h', 'o', 'j']`.

3. `var arr3 = "jones".split('');`: The variable `arr3` is assigned an array created by splitting the string `"jones"` into individual characters, resulting in `['j', 'o', 'n', 'e', 's']`.

4. `arr2.push(arr3);`: The array `arr3` is pushed as a single element to the end of `arr2`. After this operation, `arr2` will contain `['n', 'h', 'o', 'j', ['j', 'o', 'n', 'e', 's']]`.

5. `console.log("array 1: length=" + arr1.length + " last=" + arr1.slice(-1));`: This logs the length of `arr1` (which is 5) and the last element of `arr1` (which is the array `['j', 'o', 'n', 'e', 's']`). The `slice(-1)` method returns a new array containing the last element of the array. In this case, it's the array `['j', 'o', 'n', 'e', 's']`.

6. `console.log("array 2: length=" + arr2.length + " last=" + arr2.slice(-1));`: This logs the length of `arr2` (which is also 5) and the last element of `arr2`. As mentioned earlier, `arr2` contains the array `['j', 'o', 'n', 'e', 's']` as its last element. So, it outputs the same array as in the first log.

Both `arr1` and `arr2` reference the same array, so any changes made to one will affect the other. The `push()` operation on `arr2` does not modify `arr1`, but it adds the array `arr3` as an element to `arr2`, leading to the final result shown in the console logs.
